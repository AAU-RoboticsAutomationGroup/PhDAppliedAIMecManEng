# Computer Vision Assignment
## Assignment Description
First task:

-Test YoloV5 on AAU’s custom dataset​ on google colab

-Experiment with different training parameters and evaluate the results

-(optional) perform data augmentation steps, and evaluate improvements​

Second task: 

-Deploy trained model on NVIDIA’s jetson nano​

-Run live demo with usb camera

## Assignment instructions
First task:

-Upload the file "Train_YOLOv5_Mobile_phones_colab.ipynb" to the google drive and follow the training and testing instructions.

-Challenge: adapt the "Train_YOLOv5_Mobile_phones_local.ipynb" file to work in your local OS environment (e.g. linux, windows, mac)

Second task:

-Setup the nvidia jetson

-Clone YOLOv5 tensorflow repository: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5​ 

-Use the trained weights (.pt and .yaml) for AAU’s dataset, from github​ (see trained_networks_folder) or export trained tensorflow model from google colab
