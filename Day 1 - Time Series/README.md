### 1.1 Modeling Time Series Data with Deep Learning Neural Networks 
The goal of this lab is to build deep neural networks that can classify the screwing process data based on time series, or sequential, data.

A time series is a series of data points, ordered in time. For complex systems, each data point will likely be multivariate, meaning there are multiple variables for each data point. Examples of data sets with multivariate time series data are financial markets, air quality measurement, and health records. In each case, the goal is to predict one of the variable values, such as a stock price, pollutant level, or patient outcome, based on the sequential dependence of past data.

In this lab, you'll build deep neural network models to classify the screwing process from time series data contained in screwing records.

The purpose of building such a model, is to provide an analytic framework that professionals can use to detect the anomaly at any time of interest. Such a solution provides essential feedback to factories when trying to assess the quality of screwing process, or raise early warning signs to flag at-risk anomaly in a production setting.

This project and the Screwing process data are provided by AAU Smart Lab.

### 1.2 Task
Youâ€™ll use time-series classification to classify screwing process on screwing data collected from AAU screw cell. Specifically, you'll build a deep learning model that more accurately classify 2000+ data samples. In total, there are four categories.
